**Project Description:**

The goal of our project is to emulate the experience of running a petting zoo. The player will take in stray animals from the backyard after luring them by leaving out desirable items such as food or treats. The animals will then live in the petting zoo with the ability to customize which animals are “displayed” and where they reside. There will also be a shop in which you can purchase decorations for the animals’ habitat as well as the backyard to bring in more animals and customers. Each decoration will have an attribute, the indoor decorations being used to make more money and the outdoor decorations being used to lure in specific species and/or breeds of animals. There will also be a creatures tab where you can view the animals you have collected, as well as information about said animals. Animals will earn you a certain amount of money every second, which you can use to purchase the aforementioned decorations. The player’s goal is to collect all the animal breeds in JADE Zoo.
